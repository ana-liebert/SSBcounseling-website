        <h1>Elizabeth Cooley</h1>
        <p>Elizabeth Cooley is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who has experience helping clients deal with issues of grief and loss, stress management, anger management, parenting, and relationship problems.  Liz has worked with clients with clinical depression, anxiety, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance abuse or dependency.  She is also trained in EMDR (eye movement desensitization reprocessing), which is a unique and effective, evidence-based treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. </p>
        <p>Elizabeth has a wealth of life experience, as she served in the military, on the mission field in Portugal, and in private and public schools as a math teacher.  She raised five children, one with special needs, and one who was left in her care as an infant. Elizabeth returned to college later to get her Master's degree in Social Work and to fulfill her desire to work as a mental health therapist.  This pursuit resulted from Elizabeth's own inability to find Christian counseling support for her family, as her son, who was diagnosed with Autism and Bipolar I Disorder, did not benefit from the narrow lens of Christian counseling and its focus on sin and personal responsibility.  Spirit Soul Body Counseling Services was created to provide a more genuine and sensitive approach to addressing and meeting the complex needs of believers.  Elizabeth is highly qualified by her broad life experience and her professional counseling experience to provide this unique service. </p>
